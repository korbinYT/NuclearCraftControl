# NuclearCraftControl
Currently there are just the 4 basic Buttons implemented thatallow basic control over the Fission reactor in the Nuclearcraft mod.
Current implemented items are:
1. Start Reactor Button,
2. Stop reactor button,
3. Check what fuel the reactor is using,
4. RF/t generated by fuel being used,
The 5th Button currently dosnt work and just shows 0 seconds left on the fuel and will be fully implemented and fixed in the next update.
